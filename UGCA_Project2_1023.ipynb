    "From the MDS graph for each candidate, we can see the how much the general population associates each issue with each candidate. For example, for Beto O'Rourke, we can see the topics of healthcare, jobs, and money (likely due to his immpressive fundraising campaign) are associated with him. For Ted Cruz, we see jobs and healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigation into the sentiment leads us to believe that, surprisingly, all the topic associations were positive. At this point, my advice to each candidate is to differentiate your message. Both are positively viewed for healthcare and jobs, so it's hardly a differentiating fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we break Texas into big cities and small towns, we see something counter intuitive. While both candidates are mentioned equally, Beto is viewed more favorably than Cruz in small towns. It is very unusual for a liberal candidate to upstage the conservative candidate in small town Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we don't advise anyone to act upon our insights. Our analysis was over a small dataset of streaming twitter data. We noticed our data was heavily influenced by retweets. Also, our team felt that because Beto has a strong influence over the millenials and millenials tend to be active on social media, that the online results will show bias for Beto supporters."
